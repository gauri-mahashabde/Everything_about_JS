/*scope determines the accessibility of variables
before ES6 we just had 2 scopes Local and Global 
with the introduction of let and const we have block and function scope */

//Global scope 
//variable declared outside a function , works similarly with var ,let and const 

var name1 = "Joye";
console.log(name1);

let name2 = "Grey";
console.log(name2);

const name3 = "Green";
console.log(name3);
